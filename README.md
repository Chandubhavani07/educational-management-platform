# Web Data Management (WDM) Platform
## Project Overview:
The Web Data Management (WDM) platform is a comprehensive educational management solution designed to streamline and enhance the management of academic programs. The platform offers a user-friendly interface where users can log in, register, and perform specific activities based on their roles—such as students, instructors, administrators, program coordinators, and QA officers.

## Key Features:

Role-Based Access: Users can perform role-specific activities such as viewing, creating, editing, and deleting courses, assignments, and exams. Roles include Student, Administrator, Instructor, Program Coordinator, and Quality Assurance Officer.<br/>
Communication Tool: A built-in chat application allows users to communicate seamlessly across roles, implemented using Node.js with Express and Sequelize for database interactions.
Course Management: Facilitates the management of academic courses, resources, exams, and performance metrics.<br/>
Performance Metrics Visualization: Admins can view bar and pie charts representing user role distribution and other performance metrics, implemented with Recharts.<br/>
Generative AI Integration: A chatbot powered by OpenAI's API allows users to ask both generic and application-specific queries, with responses generated from integrated database data.<br/>

## Technologies Used:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React)<br/>
Backend: PHP, Node.js, Laravel Framework<br/>
Database: SQL with Sequelize ORM<br/>
APIs & Libraries: OpenAI API, Recharts, Express.js<br/>

## Challenges Faced:

Conversion Challenges: Transitioning the project from HTML to React and then to Laravel presented significant challenges.<br/>
Database Connectivity: Establishing reliable database connections and implementing CRUD functionalities required overcoming several technical obstacles.<br/>
Team Collaboration: Successfully collaborating as a team to address the challenges posed by the project’s complexity.<br/>

## Future Improvements:

Implementing two-factor authentication for enhanced security.<br/>
Integrating a microphone feature within the chat box.<br/>
Allowing third-party integrations for extended functionality.<br/>
